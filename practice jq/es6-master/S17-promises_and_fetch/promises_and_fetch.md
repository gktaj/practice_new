# Promises and Fetch

- The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

- The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.
