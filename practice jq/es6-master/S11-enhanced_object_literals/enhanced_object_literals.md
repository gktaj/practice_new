#Â Enhanced Object Literals

- ES6 PRovides a few new ways of writing out object literals to make things easier and more concise.

- When a key/value pair is identical, e.g. 'property: property', we can now condense this down to just 'property,' which is more legible.

- When we are adding methods to an object, we can skip the function keyword and colon. Before, this would have looked like 'methodName: function() {' but we can now just write 'methodName() {'.
